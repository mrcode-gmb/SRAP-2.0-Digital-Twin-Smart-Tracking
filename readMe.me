üé® Design & Project Setup Prompt for Winsoft

We are building a NITDA SRAP 2.0 Smart Tracking Dashboard.
The tech stack is Laravel Breeze + Inertia + React + TailwindCSS.

Please design and structure the frontend with the following requirements:

1. Authentication Pages

Login, Register, Forgot Password, and Reset Password.

Use Breeze auth structure (React components via Inertia).

Modern, clean UI with illustrations and logo.

2. Welcome Page (Landing Dashboard)

Title: ‚ÄúSRAP 2.0 Digital Twin ‚Äì Smart Tracking‚Äù.

Personalized greeting based on user role (e.g., Welcome Abubakar ‚Äì AI Developer).

Quick access cards/links to role-based dashboards.

3. Role-Based Dashboards

Each role should have its own dashboard view with different components:

Admin: Manage users, assign roles, view overall project progress.

Researcher: Upload datasets (Excel/CSV), view notes, research reports.

Data Analyst: KPI charts, filters, reports (placeholders for graphs).

Cybersecurity Specialist: API status, integration logs, security alerts.

AI Developer: AI detection results, anomaly reports, chatbot test interface.

4. Global Layout & Components

Sidebar navigation (dynamic items based on role).

Top navbar with notifications and profile dropdown.

Dark mode & light mode toggle.

Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).

5. UI/UX Styling

Use TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for buttons, modals, tables, and cards.

Add smooth animations with Framer Motion.

Minimal, futuristic style (similar to Reloadly dashboard).

üëâ Make sure the design is structured in Laravel Breeze + Inertia + React project structure, so we can plug it directly into Laravel backend logic later.
